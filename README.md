# Real-Time AI Assistant

## Project Overview

This project features a real-time AI assistant that utilizes advanced language models (LLMs) to deliver dynamic and interactive responses. It seamlessly integrates real-time speech transcription, LLM-based text generation, and text-to-speech conversion to create a natural conversational experience.

## Key Components

### Assembly-AI for Real-Time Transcription

Assembly-AI is employed to transcribe live audio input from a microphone. This allows immediate processing of spoken words through real-time transcription.

### Ollama’s Llama 3 for Text Generation

Transcribed text is forwarded to Ollama's Llama 3, which processes the input and generates contextually relevant responses. The model is optimized to provide concise answers, ensuring efficient interactions.

### ElevenLabs for Text-to-Speech

Responses generated by Llama 3 are converted into speech using ElevenLabs' advanced text-to-speech service. This ensures that the AI assistant can verbally communicate responses back to the user in a natural and engaging manner.

## Technical Implementation

### Initialization

The AI assistant initializes with API keys for AssemblyAI and ElevenLabs. It sets up an initial system message that guides the behavior of the Llama 3 model, defining its role or function (e.g., receptionist at a doctor's office).

### Real-Time Transcription

Using AssemblyAI’s 'RealtimeTranscriber' object, the system captures audio from the microphone and streams it for real-time transcription. Upon receiving a finalized transcript, the system pauses transcription to process the text.

### Ollama Interaction

The transcribed text is appended to a message history and sent to Llama 3 for response generation. The generated response is streamed back in chunks to ensure responsiveness and smooth interaction.

### Text-to-Speech Conversion

Each chunk of the generated response is converted into speech using ElevenLabs. The audio is streamed back to the user, facilitating a seamless conversational experience.

### Resumption of Transcription

After responding, the system resumes transcription to await the next user input.

## Example Workflow

1. **User Interaction**: User speaks into the microphone.
   
2. **Real-Time Transcription**: AssemblyAI transcribes the speech into text in real-time.
   
3. **Text Generation**: Transcribed text is forwarded to Llama 3 for generating a response.
   
4. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Llama 3's response is converted into speech by ElevenLabs and played back to the user.
   
5. **Continued Interaction**: The system resumes listening for the next input, ensuring continuous engagement.
